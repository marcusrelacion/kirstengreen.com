            The UX team hosted kick-off and workshop meetings with Product and other key members across several other
            teams. We identified our target users and what they need out of TalentNeuron. The users defined during these
            meetings were created as proto-personas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through future research, user data collected would either confirm or invalidate aspects of the
            proto-personas. Once enough data was gathered to make accurate judgements of our users' behaviors and needs,
            the proto-personas were developed into officially tested product personas.
        </p>
        <p>
            UX and Product actively collaborated with each other during the ideation phase, developing several ideas
            through wireframes and prototypes.
