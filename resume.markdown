header: About Me
body: "\n![Kirsten Green](/uploads/icon2.jpg)\n\nI am a process-driven UI Developer
  who seeks to build systems that enable design and development teams to create their
  best work together. By having a professional background in design, I bring a perspective
  that allows me to work with the challenges that affect both teams. I enjoy seeing
  ideas grow into usable products and have a passion for making that process as easy
  as possible for all involved. My move to development-focused work is less of a transition
  and more of me finding my particular role in tech. I enjoy design and development,
  so I want to make both core to my work. \n\nCurrently, I am learning how to build
  web apps using JS frameworks with a focus on Vue and React. My next goal is to become
  an expert in user interface interactions and animations. I would love to learn how
  to create games one day as well.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing video games
  and going for walks to take photos. \n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/kirstengreen](https://github.com/kirstengreen)\n\n**Email:**

    in order to craft an item for their farm. Users can search through a database
    of craftable items to find the one they want to build. Once they select an item,
    they can define how many they want to make and get the number of resources they
    need to make those items. Primary technologies used were Vue, Python, PostgreSQL,
