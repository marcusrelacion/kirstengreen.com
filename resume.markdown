header: About Me
body: "I am a process-driven UI Developer who seeks to build systems that enable design
  and development teams. I understand the challenges both teams face and strive to
  develop solutions that help them create their best work together. My primary role
  is bringing a designer’s work to life by using frameworks such as React or Vue and
  ensuring styles are consistently implemented across platforms. I enjoy unraveling
  the challenges that come with developing interactive elements and love seeing others
  achieve their goals with what I have created. \n\nCurrently, I am learning how to
  build web apps using JS frameworks with a focus on Vue and React. My next goal is
  to become an expert in user interface interactions and animations. I would love
  to learn how to create games one day as well.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing
  video games and going for walks to take photos. \n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/kirstengreen](https://github.com/kirstengreen)\n\n**Email:**

    2021*\n\nI developed a tool to help Stardew Valley players plan the building of
    their farms. It allows them to calculate how many resources they need to collect
    to craft an item. Users can search through a database of craftable items to find
    the one they wish to build. Once they have selected an item, they can define how
    many they want to make, and the tool will calculate the number of resources they
    need to craft \Lthose items.\n\n**Technologies:** Vue, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL,
