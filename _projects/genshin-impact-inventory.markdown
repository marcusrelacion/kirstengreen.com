    a project to make a RESTful app that was full CRUD. I decided to make something
    centered around the game I was playing the most, Genshin Impact. At the time,
    farming artifacts was my #1 priority, so I decided to start there.'

    ## Overview

    ### About

    The primary goal of this app is to track all of the most important items you have in your inventory. Version 1 focuses on artifacts. Artifacts are essential for making sure your character is strong and ready for whatever Teyvat has in store for them. We help you document and keep track of your artifacts so you can plan accordingly.


    ### Features

    * Create and add artifacts to your inventory
    * View all of your artifacts in a grid view
    * View the details of a specific artifact
    * Edit artifacts to account for level-ups, stat increases, change in equipped character, etc.
    * Delete an artifact if you no longer want to document it
    * Return to the website at a future date to view your artifacts again.
