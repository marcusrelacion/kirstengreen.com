- name: RecruiterNeuron Redesign
  company: Gartner
  year: 2018
  body: RecruiterNeuron, a prominent tool within the TalentNeuron suite, was heavily
    used by its large client pool but received its fair share of user critique. We
    analyzed this feedback to create an experience that made RecruiterNeuron more
    accessible to its users.

  column-1-body: "### Problem\n\nOur users frequently gave us feedback on two aspects
    of the RecruiterNeuron tool: the search experience and data visualizations. They
    felt creating a search was cumbersome and new users, in particular, had issues
    navigating through its user flow. Users also found the data visualizations unhelpful
    because they did not display the results effectively, so they were unsuitable
    for their reports and other documentation.\n\n### Solution\n\nMake the search
    easier for users to learn and utilize so they can quickly gather data for their
    analyses. The data visualizations also needed to be redesigned to make the data
    easier to understand. These new visualizations would allow users to confidently
    add them to any documentation they may need to create.\n\n### My Role\n\nI collected
    internal user data from various team members, provided analysis alongside the
    product team, created prototypes and mockups, and designed the updated user interface.
    \n\n### Project Note\n\nThis project was the catalyst that highlighted our growing
    need for a formal research practice that interacted with users directly. We began
    building our practice about a month later and would start interviewing users every
    2-3 weeks, depending on what the project needed."

    - Utilized user data and feedback to identify the core problems users had with the tool.
    - Collaborated across multiple teams to develop an executable solution. The primary teams involved were Customer Support, Product, IT/Development, and UX/Design.
    - Used **Axure RP 8** to develop prototypes for the search experience and its behavior.
    - Conducted internal user testing with colleagues that knew our users and were acutely familiar with their needs and concerns.
    - Designed the user interface in **Sketch.**
    - Shared designs with the development team in **Zeplin.io.**
    - Maintained and updated user stories in **Jira**.
