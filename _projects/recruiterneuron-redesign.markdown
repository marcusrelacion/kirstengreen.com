  company: Gartner
  year: 2018
  body: RecruiterNeuron, a prominent tool within the TalentNeuron suite, was heavily
    used by its large client pool but received its fair share of user critique. We
    analyzed this feedback to create an experience that made RecruiterNeuron more
    accessible for its users.

  column-1-body: "### Problem\n\nOur users frequently gave us feedback on two aspects
    of the RecruiterNeuron tool: the search experience and data visualizations. They
    felt creating a search was cumbersome and new users, in particular, had issues
    navigating through its user flow. Users also found the data visualizations unhelpful
    because they did not display the data effectively. This made them unsuitable for
    reuse in their personal documentation.\n\n### Solution\n\nMake the search experience
    easier for users to learn and utilize so they can quickly gather the data they
    need to develop their analysis. Additionally, the data visualizations needed to
    be redesigned to make them easier to interpret. This would also allow users to
    confidently add our visualizations to any documentation they may need to create.\n\n###
    My Role\nI collected internal user data from various team members, provided analysis
    alongside the product team, created prototypes and mockups, and designed the updated
    user interface. \n\n### Project Note\n\nThis project was the catalyst that highlighted
    our growing need for a formal research practice that talked directly to users
    on a regular basis. About a month later, we begin building that practice and would
    go on to interview several users every 2-3 weeks depending on what the particular
    project needed."

    ### Methods and Execution
    *User Experience Design, User Interface Design*

    - Utilized user data and feedback to identify the core problems users had with the tool.
    - Collaborated across multiple teams to develop an executable solution. The primary teams involved were Customer Support, Product, IT/Development, and UX/Design.
    - Used **Axure RP 8** to develop prototypes for the search experience and its behavior.
    - Conducted internal user testing with colleagues that knew our users and were acutely familiar with their needs and concerns.
    - Designed the user interface in **Sketch.**
    - Shared designs with the development team in **Zeplin.io.**
    - Maintained and updated user stories in **Jira**.
