  body: For my capstone project at General Assembly (Jan - Apr 2021), we were required
    to make an application that used a frontend and database while learning something
    new in the process. I decided to begin creating an app I have wanted to build
    for almost 2-years. As a builder/planner Stardew Valley player, I often visited
    the Stardew Valley Wiki page to make calculations for the items I wanted to craft.
    I wanted to create a tool that helped make this process easier and quicker, so
    I could get back to farming for all the resources I needed to build my items.
    As for the new technology, I decided to learn Vue.js and I couldn't be happier
    with that decision.
