    ### Problem

    The CMS templates used for CEB's global website were great for sharing data and information but not optimized for promoting and selling products.

    ### Solution

    Create a template geared towards marketing products that would retain content control through our CMS so the marketing team could update pages whenever needed without the help of the web design team.

    ### My Role
    I designed a CMS template that could be utilized across multiple products.

    ### Methods and Execution
    *Web Design*

    * All proposed designs were created in **Photoshop CC**.

  column-1-body: "## Process\n\n1. I interpreted wireframes developed by a consultant
    to make sure our client's needs were addressed in the design.\n2. Keeping our
    CMS in mind, I begin to build out a design that used existing components and needed
    minimal CSS or JavaScript intervention.                                     \n3.
    I created several designs and coordinated reviews with my team and the marketing
    team.\n4. I collaborated with a developer on our team to build out the template
    in our CMS.\n5. When complete, the template was applied to several product pages
    and went live on the CEB global website."
