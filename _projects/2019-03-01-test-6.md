# project introduction
problem-header: Problem
problem-text: |
  TalentNeuron is a excellent source for talent data, but many of its users were not able to get the most out of its data, especially when it came to its visualizations. After consulting with our Customer Support team, we identified that TalentNeuron's visualizations were often difficult to understand and required additional instruction to properly use. Our goal was to make the data in our visualizations easier to interpret and more visually appealing.

  - Identify user needs through user feedback collection and analysis
  - Collaboration across multiple teams to develop executable solutions that allow our users to easily access and understand the data they need (Customer Support, Data Science, Product, Development, and UX/Design)
  - Internal stakeholder testing

  1. Gather Product, UX, and key members across other teams for a kick-off meeting. During these meetings, we would identify our users and their needs, what we could solve given our constraints, and begin preliminary ideation.
  2. UX and Product would then actively collaborate between each other developing several ideas from wireframes into prototypes, while bringing in team members from Data Science and Development to discuss viability and additional ideas they might have.
  3. We would then test prototypes with internal stakeholders who know our users the most and identified areas of improvement.
  4. Once the prototypes and designs were complete, we worked with product to finalize the development story and continued to work with development throughout implementation.
  5. Further testing would be conducted with users to determine the visualizations effectiveness by seeing if users are able to understand and use the data. We also identify opportunities that can add to their experience through this process
