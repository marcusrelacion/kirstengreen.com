  body: TalentNeuron is a top source for talent-related data, but many of its users
    were not able to get the most out of its data. That discovery pushed us to explore
    how we provide and display data throughout the platform.

    ### Problem

    After consulting with our customer support team, we identified that TalentNeuron's visualizations either felt incomplete to our users or were difficult to understand. That meant many of our users needed additional instruction on how to use and interpret the platform's dataâ€“ taking up valuable time from both our users and our team.

    ### Solution

    Create and develop data visualizations that are easy to understand and filter, while offering users the flexibility to use them for internal documentation that would drive data-backed talent decisions.

    ### My Role

    I developed working prototypes, conducted internal UX testing, consulted with Data Science and Development to test for backend feasibility, and designed the UI.
