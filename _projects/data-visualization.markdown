- name: Data Visualization

  year: 2017-18
  body: TalentNeuron is a top source for talent-related data, but many of its users
    were not able to get the most out of its data. That discovery pushed us to explore
    how we provide and display data throughout the platform.

    ### Problem

    After consulting with our customer support team, we identified that TalentNeuron's visualizations either felt incomplete to our users or were difficult to understand. That meant many of our users needed additional instruction on how to use and interpret the platform's dataâ€“ taking up valuable time from both our users and our team.

    ### Solution

    Create and develop data visualizations that are easy to understand and filter, while offering users the flexibility to use them for internal documentation that would drive data-backed talent decisions.

    ### My Role

    I developed working prototypes, conducted internal UX testing, consulted with Data Science and Development to test for backend feasibility, and designed the UI.

    ### Methods and Execution

    *User Experience Design, User Interface Design*

    - Identified user needs through user feedback collection and analysis.
    - Collaborated across multiple teams to develop executable solutions. The teams involved were Customer Support, Data Science, Product, IT/Development, and UX/Design.
    - Conducted internal user testing, which included experienced and inexperienced users.
    - Developed wireframes and prototypes using **Axure RP 8**.
    - Designed the UI in **Sketch.**
    - Uploaded the UI to **Zeplin.io** so we could share design specs with the development team. We also used this platform as a communication tool for any questions concerning the design and its implementation.
    - Utilized **Jira** to keep track of story and sprint progress. This project spanned across many sprints and, true to Agile, additional requirements and design changes were added when we learned more about our users.
